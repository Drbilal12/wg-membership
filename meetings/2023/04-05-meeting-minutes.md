## Agenda

Bring up GitHub Projects to check for any agenda items.

### **Review actions from the previous meeting**
- 

### **Membership Form Updates**

* The committee reviewed new membership applications.Nicole moved the form into Google for better accessibility and sharing. She noted that rows highlighted in green have Welcome Emails prepped and ready to send. The second tab of the spreadsheet includes a template of the welcome email. Nicole added that when she sends the welcome email, she will send the same information to the new member via GitHub.

* The committee discussed whether to approve or deny applications that meet all the eligibility requirements but have low activity/commit metrics on GitHub. They agreed to approve the applications and monitor for suspicious activity.

* The website hasn’t been updated yet to indicate the 2-week processing period for new applications, but the application itself indicates that the Membership Committee meets every two weeks and applicants should expect processing delays.

* The committee assigned applications for review during the call.

* **3/1/23 Action Item:** Nicole to draft template email for denied membership applications.

* **Update: Item in progress;** need to agree on the threshold metrics for accepting applications to inform why an application is denied.

### **Discord:**

* **Jessica proposed two options to increase the membership value of the Discord channels:**
  1. Remove non-members
  2. Create private channels specifically for DNF members.

The committee would need to verify Discord handles compared to other verified social handles for each member, which could be time-consuming. The membership application would be updated to request Discord handles moving forward.

* ACTION: Nicole to update the membership application to include discord handles.

* Aneesh noted that making a private channel may not be the best solution. The newsletter includes a link to join the Discord channels, and many members may not actively post in the channels but do appreciate the forum. He added that he created several issues in GitHub to establish membership molds, identifying DNF “insiders,” project maintainers, educators, etc., using tags.

  * Jessica commented that this will be helpful in the future, but the first step is to create the member channel.

* The committee discussed how to obtain the Discord handles for current members. Aneesh suggested publishing a form in the general channel that would ask users to verify their DNF membership and join the private channel.

* **ACTION:** Jessica to draft the form.
  * The committee discussed whether to create a channel for DNF sponsors.

* **ACTION:** Aneesh to update his proposal to include a channel for sponsors.

* **ACTION:** Jessica to contact the Sponsorship Committee chair (Iris).

* The committee discussed whether to change the URL for $5/month. Aneesh noted that $5/month for a large communication channel isn’t that much; Jessica added that depending on the other benefits provided, $5 to change a URL may be excessive as it's per member.

### GitHub Issues:

* **Issue Raised** [Exclusivity of Discord #108](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/108)

* **Issue Raised** [A CFP (Call for proposal) channel on Discord #106](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/106)
* **Issue Raised** [Customize discord invite url #104](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/104)

### **Nominating Committee**

* Javier and Jessica are reviewing the proposed timeline for the 2023 election cycle. The original candidate application form is no longer accessible, so Nicole will draft a new version. Jessica and Javier intend to meet in the coming weeks to discuss next steps.

* **ACTION:** Nicole to draft the candidate application form.

* **ACTION:** Javier/Jessica to discuss next steps.

### **Any Other Business** 

* Rich Lander has received several emails from someone claiming to have submitted a membership application and requesting an update. Nicole noted there is no record of the individual’s application and is working to resolve.

* The Call for Proposals for the June DNF Summit was published in the recent newsletter; one proposal was received. The Outreach Committee will manage the DNF Summits moving forward.

* The Marketing Committee is drafting a survey for DNF members and will likely be distributed next month.

* Nicole is conducting another audit of the MeetUp groups, working to downsize again.

* Jess suggested publishing a .NET Dogs edition of the newsletter (slightly in jest)
