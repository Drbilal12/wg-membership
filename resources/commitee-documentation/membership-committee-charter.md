## Membership

- On seeing this [Jessica White](https://github.com/wordshaker) will accept the issue and close it, then send you the next meetings invite.
- After attending two meetings, you will be added to the CODEOWNERS of this repository and be added to the committee GitHub Teams.

### Expected Level of Contribution

To remain a member of the committee we ask that you attempt to attend meetings at least once a month. If you are unable to attend at this frequency or have to miss a couple for extenuating circumstances, you will be expected to raise this with the committee. You won't need to provide specifics, it's to let the group know you intend to take part in future.

If you cannot attend at that frequency, you could also contribute by submitting issues or pull requests to the repository.

Each committee meeting will have a draft agenda in GitHub available before the meeting. This is how to check when issues you are passionate about are going to be up for discussion and action votes.

## Termination of Committee Membership

On a quarterly basis, the chair, scribe or appointed representative will review levels of contribution from [members of the membership GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-foundation/teams/membership/members). If the expected contribution levels have not been met, without you talking to the committee about the reasoning for the decline in your contributions you will be contacted via email. If you have not responded within 30 days of attempted contact, your membership to this team will be revoked.

After termination, you can re-apply to join the committee if you so wish.

## Chairperson

The Chairperson of the committee is an elected member of the Board of Directors. They will have volunteered to be the chair and spokesperson of the committee.

The current Chairperson of the membership committee is [Jessica White](mailto:Jessica.White@dotnetfoundation.org)
